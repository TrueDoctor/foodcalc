# foodcalc frontend in ELM
This is a reimplementation of the iced ui in elm.

# Development
On linux, the script `bin/build.sh` enables hot reloading when opening `main.html` in the browser (no server needed). The script was found on the internet.

# Styling
For simplicity [Pico](https://picocss.com/) is used, such that no further css classes are needed if you use the correct html tags.
